Multimodal handheld device

The handheld device is a multi-purpose instrument capable of performing fluorescence and reflectance measurements in the UV-VIS-NIR range. The integrated light sources in the optical head include UV-VIS LEDs and incandescent lamps, which can be customised to the requirements of the customer's application. The handheld device can be used to build up spectral libraries and perform in-depth analyses of spectral data.

The graphical user interface (GUI) application is made with Python, PyQt5 and the Qt Designer (Version 5.11.1). 
It provides the basic functionalities for operating and controlling the handheld device.
